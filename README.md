Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) UI

Project Overview
This project is a web-based application that helps manage roles and users effectively. It allows administrators to manage user information, assign roles, set permissions, and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. It also includes features for sorting, filtering, and pagination in tables for a smoother experience while dealing with large datasets.

Features

View detailed user information including roles and statuses.
Search, sort, and filter users by name, role, and status.
Pagination to manage large user lists.
Role Management:
Manage different user roles within the system.
Assign permissions to roles.
CRUD operations for roles, similar to user management.
Technologies Used
Frontend:

React.js for building the user interface.
Material UI for designing responsive components.
React State for managing data flow and UI states.
React Hooks (useState, useEffect) for managing component logic.
